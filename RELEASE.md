# Release Guidelines

To release a new version of the _Tool Versions Update Action_ follow the steps
found in this file (using v0.1.2 as an example):

1. Make sure that your local copy of the repository is up-to-date, sync:

   ```shell
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   ```

   Or clone:

   ```shell
   git clone git@github.com:ericcornelissen/tool-versions-update-action.git
   ```

1. Update the version number in the `.version` file following [Semantic
   Versioning]:

   ```diff
   - 0.1.1
   + 0.1.2
   ```

1. Update the changelog by replacing all instances of `_No changes yet._` with
   `_Version bump only._`

1. Update the changelog by manually adding the following after the
   `## [Unreleased]` line:

   ```markdown

   ### `tool-versions-update-action`

   - _No changes yet._

   ### `tool-versions-update-action/commit`

   - _No changes yet._

   ### `tool-versions-update-action/pr`

   - _No changes yet._

   ## [0.1.2] - YYYY-MM-DD

   ```

   The date should follow the year-month-day format where single-digit months
   and days should be prefixed with a `0` (e.g. `2022-01-01`).

1. Commit the changes to a new branch and push using:

   ```shell
   git checkout -b release-$(sha1sum .version | awk '{print $1}')
   git add .version CHANGELOG.md
   git commit --message "Version bump"
   git push origin release-$(sha1sum .version | awk '{print $1}')
   ```

1. Create a Pull Request to merge the new branch into `main`.

1. Merge the Pull Request if the changes look OK and all continuous integration
   checks are passing.

1. Immediately after the Pull Request is merged, sync the `main` branch:

   ```shell
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   ```

1. Create a [git tag] for the new version and push it:

   ```shell
   git tag "v$(cat .version)"
   git push origin "v$(cat .version)"
   ```

   > **Note** At this point, the continuous delivery automation may pick up and
   > complete the release process. If not, or only partially, continue following
   > the remaining steps.

1. Update the `v0` branch to point to the same commit as the new tag:

   ```shell
   git checkout v0
   git merge main
   ```

1. Push the `v0` branch:

   ```shell
   git push origin v0
   ```

1. Create a [GitHub Release] for the [git tag] of the new release. The release
   title should be "Release {_version_}" (e.g. "Release v0.1.2"). The release
   text should be identical.

   Ensure the version is published to the [GitHub Marketplace] as well.
