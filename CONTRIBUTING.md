# Contributing Guidelines

The maintainers of the _Tool Versions Update Action_ welcome contributions and
corrections. This includes improvements to the documentation or code base,
tests, bug fixes, and implementations of new features. We recommend you open an
issue before making any substantial changes so you can be sure your work won't
be rejected. But for small changes, such as fixing a typo, you can open a Pull
Request directly.

If you decide to make a contribution, please use the following workflow:

- Fork the repository.
- Create a new branch from the latest `main`.
- Make your changes on the new branch.
- Commit to the new branch and push the commit(s).
- Open a Pull Request against `main`.
